    💌 Favourite memory
    <div class="message" id="message">
      "Hmm… I miss every moment we shared, but there’s one memory that keeps replaying in my mind. 
      We were in the elevator—you stood behind me and wrapped your arms around me so naturally. 
      You were wearing your cozy homewear, and I turned my head, saw you in the mirror… your head resting on my shoulder. 
      You looked so peaceful and comfortable.
      Now, every time when I am in a lift, I wish I could see you again when I look at the mirror.💗"

    💌 What goals do you want us to achieve as a couple?
    <div class="message" id="message2">
      "The plan is to move together first, then you can earn a lot money to support me! 💗"

    <div class="letter" id="loveLetter3">
    💌 How have we changed since we first got together?
    <div class="message" id="message3">
      "I can feel more of your love now than the beginning of our relationship. Do you feel you love me more now?
      Although those uncertain moment still comes up sometime, I guess its difficult for me to trust people because what I experienced before.
      I am afraid to get hurt, loose love, especially loose you. Does that bother you?💗"
